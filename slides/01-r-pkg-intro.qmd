# What is an `R` package and when should I make one?

![](img/panda.png){fig-align="center" width=10%}

## This question is key!

::: incremental
- An `R` package is a <span style="color: purple;">collection</span> of functions, tests, data, compiled code, and standardized documentation
- The reason to create a package is mostly about <span style="color: purple;">creating code that should be easier to reuse and share</span>

## More specifically...

- `R` packages are created:
  - When your <span style="color: purple;">DRY</span> ("Do Not Repeat Yourself) radar goes off
  - When you think your code has general usefulness others could benefit from (this could include future you)
  - When you want to <span style="color: purple;">share</span> data (R packages in particular are used quite heavily for this)

. . .

## Let's start with a motivating example

::: incremental
- Suppose that, <span style="color: purple;">in many of your analyses</span>, you find yourself repeatedly coding the distribution of observations over the classes (i.e., categories) of a given variable in your dataset
- You find yourself rewriting code, copying and pasting code and/or copying and pasting files containing the code to do this. And in doing so, you sometimes (or often!) make trivial mistakes.
- You wonder whether others doing similar analyses face this problem as well, and want to share your (eventual) solution with others.

## Counting observations across classes code example

- The code below is counting how many cars in `mtcars` (composed of 32 observations) have `4`, `6`, and `8` cylinders

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|3|4|5|6"
library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)

mtcars |>
  group_by(cyl) |>
  summarize(count = n()) |>
  rename("class" = cyl)
```

## Is an `R` package the answer to our pains with how we have been previously trying to reuse our code?

## Yes, it is!

::: incremental
- A published package is crucial in everyday shareable code
- It encompasses code, data, documentation, and <span style="color: purple;">test functions</span>

## How are `R` packages shared and downloaded?

- We have the [**Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)**](https://cran.r-project.org)

. . .

> *CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for `R`.*

. . .

- As of today, there are over <span style="color: purple;">20,000 packages available</span> on the CRAN

## What will be our learning goals?

::: incremental
- Develop `R` packages from scratch via a <span style="color: purple;">toy example</span>
- Introduce the concept of <span style="color: purple;">testing</span> to ensure our package coding works as expected
- Include the corresponding <span style="color: purple;">documentation</span>
- Introduce <span style="color: purple;">continuous integration</span> using <span style="color: purple;">GitHub Actions</span>
- Share and publish packages on <span style="color: purple;">GitHub</span> and <span style="color: purple;">CRAN</span> 
- Define <span style="color: purple;">copyright rules</span> when building, sharing, and using packages
- Choose the most appropriate <span style="color: purple;">license</span>
