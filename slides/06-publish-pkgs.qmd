## Level 1: Publishing on GitHub

-   GitHub is where almost all R packages start out publishing, and continue publishing development versions between releases.

-   For this to work, you need to push your package code to GitHub and provide users instructions like this to download, build and install your package:

```         
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("username/package")
```

## Level 2: Publishing on CRAN

-   CRAN (founded in 1997) stands for the “Comprehensive R Archive Network”.
-   CRAN is a collection of sites which host identical copies of:
    -   R distribution(s)
    -   the contributed extensions (i.e., packages)
    -   documentation for R
    -   binaries (i.e., packages)

## What does it mean to be a CRAN package?

::: incremental
-   A stamp of authenticity: passed quality control of the check utility

-   Ease of installation: can be installed by users via `install.packages()` and binaries are available for Windows & Mac OS’s.

-   Discoverability: listed as a package on CRAN

-   However, CRAN makes no assertions about the package’s usability, or the efficiency and correctness of the computations it performs

## How to submit a package to CRAN

::: incremental
1.  Pick a version number.

2.  Run and document `R CMD check`.

3.  Check that you’re aligned with CRAN policies.

4.  Update `README.md` and `NEWS.md`.

5.  Submit the package to CRAN.

6.  Prepare for the next version by updating version numbers.

7.  Publicize the new version.

## Notes on submitting to CRAN

-   Your package must pass `R CMD check` with the current development version of R.

-   It must work on at least two platforms (CRAN uses the following 4 platforms: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris) - use GitHub Actions to ensure this before submitting to CRAN!

> If you decide to submit a package to CRAN, follow the detailed instructions in [Chapter 22: Releasing to Cran](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html) from the R packages book by Hadley Wickham & Jenny Bryan.
